# Northstar Supply Ecommerce UI Context

## 1. Project Goal

This project is a professional frontend implementation plan and starter build for a modern ecommerce website UI inspired by the browsing structure and product merchandising rhythm of https://leonoutfits.com/.

The goal is not to clone that brand. The goal is to build an original, maintainable, reusable storefront UI that captures the same type of experience:

- category-led homepage browsing
- strong product-card presentation
- sale-price and quick-buy behavior
- simple but effective catalog filtering
- product detail, cart, and checkout flow
- about and policy pages with shared templates

The implementation must use only:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No UI framework should be used.

## 2. Reference Site Analysis

The target reference site has a clear ecommerce content rhythm.

### Homepage structure observed

1. Hero/banner area
2. Shop by category section
3. Featured products grid
4. Repeated category spotlight sections
5. Footer with quick links, contact, and social links

### Core UI patterns observed

- Category-first discovery
- Product cards with image, name, sale state, price, original price, and CTA buttons
- Repeated visual merchandising blocks by category
- Simple browse pages with filtering and category navigation
- Minimal informational pages for policies and brand information

### What should be followed

- Content rhythm
- Ecommerce hierarchy
- Catalog behavior expectations
- Compact footer/legal layout style

### What should not be copied directly

- Brand name
- Logo
- Product names
- Product images
- Policy text
- Exact colors, layout values, and branding language

This project therefore uses an inspired direction with original branding: `Northstar Supply`.

## 3. Scope

The approved scope for the first implementation milestone includes:

### Storefront pages

- Homepage
- All products page
- Category page
- Product detail page
- Cart page
- Checkout page

### Static content pages

- About page
- Privacy policy page
- Terms and conditions page
- Return and cancellation page

### UI behavior scope

- Shared announcement bar, header, footer, and mini-cart drawer
- Search, category filter, price filter, and sorting on catalog page
- Add to cart and buy now actions
- Cart persistence with localStorage
- Quantity update behavior
- Checkout form UI with summary panel

### Explicit exclusions for this milestone

- Real backend integration
- Real payments
- Authentication
- Real inventory service
- Real shipping calculation
- Admin panel
- CMS integration

## 4. Brand and Design Direction

The design direction should feel bold, streetwear-oriented, and modern without looking generic.

### Visual direction

- light warm background instead of flat white
- dark high-contrast text
- one warm accent color for badges and highlights
- oversized typography for section headlines
- large atmospheric media panels in place of placeholder product imagery
- rounded cards with soft shadows and clean spacing

### Typography direction

- Display font: `Sora`
- Body/UI font: `Manrope`

### Tone

- clean and confident
- modern streetwear feel
- product-first, not overly decorative
- maintainable and scalable for real ecommerce usage

## 5. Tech Stack Decision

### Core stack

- HTML5 multi-page structure
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Custom CSS layers for tokens, components, and sections
- Vanilla JavaScript ES modules
- Vite for development and production build
- PostCSS for Tailwind integration

### Why Vite is acceptable

Vite is used only as a build and development tool. It is not a UI framework. The runtime output remains plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

This gives the project:

- fast local development
- clean asset handling
- multi-page entry support
- maintainable ES module imports
- production build support without framework overhead

### Architecture principles

- Page entry files stay thin.
- Reusable markup/render logic lives in `src/components`.
- Shared data lives in one place.
- State logic is separated from rendering.
- Styling is split by responsibility.
- Shared shell is used across every page.

This structure is intended to keep future updates easy and low-risk.

## 7. Styling Strategy

Styling is intentionally split into multiple layers so that future edits remain manageable.

### `src/styles/tokens.css`

Contains:

- colors
- font variables
- radius values
- shadows
- container width
- theme gradients for placeholder media

### `src/styles/utilities.css`

Contains:

- shared container class
- section-heading helper
- surface-card class
- stack utilities
- small reusable layout helpers

### `src/styles/components.css`

Contains:

- announcement bar
- header/nav styles
- button systems
- badges
- product/category media panels
- form fields
- cart drawer behavior

### `src/styles/sections.css`

Contains:

- hero composition
- spotlight band layout
- trust band styling
- catalog page layout
- sticky filter panel rules

### `src/styles/app.css`

Acts as the main CSS entry file and imports Tailwind and all custom layers.

## 8. Reusable Component Inventory

### Global shell components

- announcement bar
- header
- desktop navigation
- mobile menu
- footer
- mini-cart drawer

### Commerce components

- product card
- category card
- catalog filter panel
- sort toolbar
- product gallery block
- quantity control
- order summary panel

### Static page component

- reusable support and policy page shell with sidebar cards and FAQ blocks

These components are rendered with JS functions instead of duplicated HTML across pages.

## 9. Data Model

The current seeded data is stored in `src/data/site.js`.

### Site meta

- brand name
- tagline
- announcement text
- contact data
- social links
- trust highlights

### Commerce meta

- free-shipping threshold
- cart benefit content
- checkout steps
- shipping zones
- promo codes
- payment methods
- checkout notes

### Category fields

- id
- slug
- name
- kicker
- description
- theme
- media

### Product fields

- id
- slug
- name
- category
- price
- originalPrice
- badge
- stock
- theme
- sizes
- colors
- shortDescription
- description
- featured
- spotlight
- media
- profile metadata for PDP guidance
- availability metadata for shared status messaging
- shipping metadata for dispatch and delivery reuse
- care metadata for shared post-purchase guidance

### Static content fields

- eyebrow
- title
- intro
- sections array

This keeps the project data-driven from the start so new products or new sections can be added without rewriting page markup.

## 11. Interaction Plan

### Implemented interactions in current milestone

- open/close mini-cart drawer
- open mobile menu
- add to cart from product cards

- search products
- filter by category
- filter by price range
- sort products
- update cart quantity
- remove item from cart
- clear cart after demo checkout submission

### Interaction rules

- shared cart state comes from localStorage
- product and cart pages should never own duplicate cart logic
- global shell should reflect cart count changes automatically
- browse behavior should always derive from one product dataset

## 12. Maintainability Rules

To keep the project easy to maintain, follow these rules for future development:

1. Do not duplicate header, footer, or cart drawer markup across pages.
2. Keep shared render logic inside `src/components`.
3. Keep data in `src/data` rather than hardcoding content in page scripts.
4. Keep visual tokens in `tokens.css` as the single source of truth.
5. Use section-level CSS only for composition, not for deeply repeated patterns.
6. Use Tailwind utilities for layout speed, but keep reusable design patterns in component classes.
7. Keep page entry scripts focused on bootstrapping only.
8. Replace placeholder policy text and demo brand content before any real deployment.

## 13. Accessibility and Performance Direction

### Accessibility requirements

- semantic HTML landmarks
- keyboard-accessible buttons and links
- clear form labels
- visible focus states
- readable contrast ratios
- descriptive CTA labels

### Performance requirements

- minimal JS for core UI
- shared data-driven rendering
- no framework runtime
- clear CSS layering
- production build through Vite

## 17. Final Development Note

This project is already structured as a professional frontend base, not just a loose static template.

The key principle is simple:

- shared shell
- shared data
- shared component renderers
- separated styling layers
- thin page entry files

If future work follows this structure, the project will remain easy to edit, scale, and maintain.
